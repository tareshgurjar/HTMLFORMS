        <h1>What is Semantic HTML?</h1>
    <p>
        Semantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the content rather than its appearance. Semantic HTML uses tags that describe the purpose of the content, such as <header>, <nav>, and <section>, rather than tags that describe how the content looks, such as <font> or <center>.
